mov eax, [esi+4] ; This instruction assumes esi points to a valid memory location.  If esi is uninitialized or points to an invalid memory address, it will cause a segmentation fault or access violation.
mov ecx, [edi+8] ; Similar issue here.  Incorrect pointer handling can result in undefined behavior.
add eax, ecx ; Arithmetic operations are vulnerable if registers contain unexpected values due to faulty memory access.
mov [ebx], eax ; Writing to an invalid memory location could overwrite critical data or cause a crash.
